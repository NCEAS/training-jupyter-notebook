# Introduction to Jupyter Notebook
Short introduction to Jupyter Notebook given as NCEAS roundtable. We used NCEAS Jupyterhub server to go over the Notebook interface and do a quick dive into Python using pandas to investigate the housing market in Santa Barbara. As many experienced R users were attending the session, the exposure to pandas was aimed to show how to do basic data wrangling using pandas instead of R (tidyverse).
